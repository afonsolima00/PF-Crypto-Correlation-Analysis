# Step 1

Just run a simple python file connected to the some api. hen it terminates or I end just run some statistics to extract insights 

# Other

Note to future self would probably be better to divide this into 2 steps, i.e., have a seperate file to use the data extracted in json and run some statistical measures

=> Actually ended up following with the plan
